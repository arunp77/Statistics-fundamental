    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from a sample or population. It involves summarizing and describing the main features of the data, such as measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (e.g., range, variance, standard deviation). Descriptive statistics aims to provide a clear and concise summary of the data that can be easily understood and communicated to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is the branch of statistics that deals with drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It involves using probability theory to estimate population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) from sample statistics (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) and testing hypotheses about the relationship between variables. Inferential statistics aims to make generalizations about the population based on the information obtained from the sample.`\n",

    "### Main uses of the Inferential statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics is used to make generalizations and predictions about populations based on sample data. Some of the main uses of inferential statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimation:** Inferential statistics can be used to estimate population parameters (such as the mean or proportion) based on sample data.\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis testing:** Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses about population parameters using sample data.\n",
    "3. **Prediction:** Inferential statistics can be used to make predictions about future observations or outcomes based on past data.\n",
    "4. **Generalization:** Inferential statistics can be used to generalize findings from a sample to the larger population.\n",
    "5. **Decision-making:** Inferential statistics can be used to support decision-making in various fields, such as business, medicine, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sampling error in inferential statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the size of a sample is always smaller than the size of the population, some of the population isn’t captured by sample data. This creates sampling error, which is the difference between the true population values (called parameters) and the measured sample values (called statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling error arises any time you use a sample, even if your sample is random and unbiased. For this reason, there is always some uncertainty in inferential statistics. However, using probability sampling methods reduces this uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating population parameters from sample statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics of samples and populations are described by numbers called statistics and parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statistic is a measure that describes the sample (e.g., sample mean).\n",
    "- A parameter is a measure that describes the whole population (e.g., population mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling error** is the difference between a parameter and a corresponding statistic. Since in most cases you don’t know the real population parameter, you can use inferential statistics to estimate these parameters in a way that takes sampling error into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of estimates:** There are two important types of estimates you can make about the population: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Point estimates:** A point estimate is a single value estimate of a parameter. For instance, a sample mean is a point estimate of a population mean.\n",
    "2. **Interval estimates:** An interval estimate gives you a range of values where the parameter is expected to lie. A confidence interval is the most common type of interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of estimates are important for gathering a clear idea of where a parameter is likely to lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to follow to eastimate the population parameters from sample statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps outline the process of estimating population parameters from sample statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define the population of interest:** Clearly define the population from which the sample is drawn.\n",
    "- **Determine the sampling technique:** Determine the sampling technique to be used to ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "- **Collect the sample:** Collect a sample of appropriate size from the population using the chosen sampling technique.\n",
    "- **Calculate sample statistics:** Calculate the appropriate sample statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) based on the collected sample.\n",
    "- **Make inferences:** Use the sample statistics to make inferences about the population parameters (e.g., mean, standard deviation).\n",
    "- **Estimate population parameters:** Use the sample statistics to estimate the population parameters, including point estimates and confidence intervals.\n",
    "- **Assess the reliability of the estimate:** Determine the reliability of the estimate using statistical tests such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, estimating population parameters from sample statistics involves collecting a representative sample, calculating sample statistics, and using these statistics to make inferences about the population parameters. The process requires careful consideration of the sampling technique, sample size, and reliability of the estimates."

    "### Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing is a formal process of statistical analysis using inferential statistics. The goal of hypothesis testing is to compare populations or assess relationships between variables using samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypotheses, or predictions, are tested using statistical tests. Statistical tests also estimate sampling errors so that valid inferences can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical tests can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Parametric**: parametric tests are considered more statistically powerful because they are more likely to detect an effect if one exists. Parametric tests make assumptions that include the following:\n",
    "        - the population that the sample comes from follows a normal distribution of scores\n",
    "        - the sample size is large enough to represent the population\n",
    "        - the variances, a measure of variability, of each group being compared are similar\n",
    "        - Example: t-test, ANOVA, Regression analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "        - **t-test:** Used to compare the means of two groups when the data are normally distributed and the variances of the two groups are equal.\n",
    "        - **ANOVA:** Used to compare the means of three or more groups when the data are normally distributed and the variances of the groups are equal.\n",
    "        - **Regression analysis:** Used to model the relationship between two or more variables when the data are normally distributed and the assumptions of the model are met.\n",

    "    - **Non-parametric**: When your data violates any of these assumptions, non-parametric tests are more suitable. Non-parametric tests are called “distribution-free tests” because they don’t assume anything about the distribution of the population data.\n",
    "        - Example: Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation coefficient\n",

    "Here's a step-by-step guide to hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The null hypothesis (denoted $H_0$) is the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between two or more groups, or no significant relationship between two or more variables. The alternative hypothesis (denoted $H_a$) is the hypothesis that there is a significant difference or relationship. \n",
    "    - For example, in a clinical trial, the null hypothesis might be that there is no difference in effectiveness between a new drug and a placebo, while the alternative hypothesis might be that the new drug is more effective than the placebo. \n",
    "    - <a href=\"#null-and-alternative-hypothesis\" style=\"display:inline-block;padding:5px 10px;background-color:#337ab7;color:#fff;text-decoration:none;border-radius:5px;font-size:14px;\">Go to detailed section</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose a significance level:** The significance level (denoted $\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The most common significance level used in hypothesis testing is 0.05 (or 5%). \n",
    "    - <a href=\"#significance-level\" style=\"display:inline-block;padding:5px 10px;background-color:#337ab7;color:#fff;text-decoration:none;border-radius:5px;font-size:14px;\">Go to detailed section</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select an appropriate statistical test:** The choice of statistical test depends on the type of data and the research question. For example, a t-test might be used to compare the means of two groups, while ANOVA might be used to compare the means of three or more groups.\n",
    "    - <a href=\"#selecting-a-appropriate-statistical-test\" style=\"display:inline-block;padding:5px 10px;background-color:#337ab7;color:#fff;text-decoration:none;border-radius:5px;font-size:14px;\">Go to detailed section</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the test statistic:** In hypothesis testing, the test statistic is a numerical value calculated from the sample data that is used to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis. The test statistic measures how far the sample estimate is from the null hypothesis value in terms of the standard error of the estimate. The choice of test statistic depends on the type of data and the assumptions of the statistical test. The formula for the test statistic depends on the specific test being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - For example, in a t-test, the test statistic is calculated as: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        $$t = \\frac{(\\bar{x} - \\mu)}{s/\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "        where $x̄$ is the sample means, $\\mu$ is the hypothesized population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size. The t-test produces a t-value, which is compared to a critical value from the t-distribution based on the degrees of freedom and the desired significance level.\n",
    "    - The z-test, on the other hand, is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (typically $n\\geq 30$). The formula for the z-test is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        $$z = \\frac{x̄ - μ}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "        \n",
    "        where $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the hypothesized population mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size. The z-test produces a z-value, which is compared to a critical value from the standard normal distribution based on the desired significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both the t-test and z-test are used to test hypotheses about the population mean based on sample data. The choice between the two tests depends on the nature of the data and the sample size. If the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, the t-test is appropriate. If the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large, the z-test is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate the p-value:** The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is calculated based on the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than the significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "    - To calculate the p-value, we need to compare the test statistic to its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis. \"_The p-value is the area under the sampling distribution curve that is more extreme than the observed test statistic._\" \n",
    "        - If the p-value is small (typically less than the significance level), it indicates that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, and the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The exact calculation of the p-value depends on the type of test and the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. For example, \n",
    "        - in a t-test, the p-value can be calculated using the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, where n is the sample size. - In a z-test, the p-value can be calculated using the standard normal distribution. \n",
    "        - In other tests, such as the chi-square test or F-test, the p-value is calculated using the chi-square or F distribution, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In general, the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. \n",
    "        - A p-value less than the significance level (usually 0.05 or 0.01) indicates that the result is statistically significant and that the null hypothesis should be rejected. \n",
    "        - A p-value greater than the significance level indicates that the result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis should not be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In summary, the p-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis and is calculated by comparing the test statistic to its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis. The exact calculation of the p-value depends on the type of test and the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. A small p-value indicates that the result is statistically significant and that the null hypothesis should be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret the results:** If the p-value is less than the significance level, the result is considered statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the result is not considered statistically significant, and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected."

    "3. **Number of groups:** The number of groups being compared can also influence the choice of test. For example, t-tests are appropriate for comparing two groups, while ANOVA is appropriate for comparing three or more groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumptions of the test:** Most statistical tests have certain assumptions that must be met in order for the test to be valid. For example, t-tests assume that the data are normally distributed, while ANOVA assumes that the variances of the groups are equal. Violating these assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Research question:** Finally, the research question itself can guide the choice of test. For example, if the research question involves the relationship between two variables, a correlation or regression analysis may be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, selecting an appropriate statistical test involves considering the type of data being analyzed, the sample size, the number of groups, the assumptions of the test, and the research question. By carefully selecting the appropriate test, researchers can ensure that their results are valid and can make meaningful conclusions from their data."

    "## 2. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal, against the alternative hypothesis that at least one group mean is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA test is based on the F-statistic, which is calculated by dividing the variance between the groups by the variance within the groups. The F-statistic follows an F-distribution with degrees of freedom based on the number of groups and the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to perform an ANOVA test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "    - H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = ... = μk (all group means are equal)\n",
    "    - Ha: at least one group mean is different from the others\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose a significance level (α) and determine the degrees of freedom for the F-distribution:\n",
    "    - Degrees of freedom between groups: k - 1\n",
    "    - Degrees of freedom within groups: N - k, where N is the total number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collect and organize the data into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSbetween):\n",
    "    - SSbetween = ∑ni(x̄i - x̄)^2, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    where ni is the number of observations in group i, x̄i is the mean of group i, and x̄ is the overall mean\n",
    "\n",

    "    - SSwithin = ∑(xi - x̄i)^2, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    where xi is the ith observation in group i\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate the mean square between groups (MSbetween):\n",
    "    - MSbetween = SSbetween / (k - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Calculate the mean square within groups (MSwithin):\n",
    "    - MSwithin = SSwithin / (N - k)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Calculate the F-statistic:\n",
    "    - F = MSbetween / MSwithin\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Calculate the p-value associated with the F-statistic using a table of F-distributions or a statistical software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Compare the p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of at least two groups. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the means of any of the groups.\n",
